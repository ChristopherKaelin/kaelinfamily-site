<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>Who I Am</h2>
	<p>
		Hey there! I'm Chris, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm a proud grandfather, husband, and lifelong learner 
		living in the beautiful Bluegrass State of Kentucky with my family.
	</p>
	<p>
		First and foremost, I'm a family man. Being a grandparent has been one of life's greatest joys—there's nothing quite like seeing 
		the world through a child's eyes again or watching them discover something new for the first time. My family keeps me grounded, 
		laughing, and always on my toes. Whether we're having Sunday dinners, planning family adventures, or just spending quiet time 
		together, these moments with my loved ones are what matter most.
	</p>
	<p>
		I happen to love technology too. After serving in the Air Force and spending years building software, I've discovered that what 
		I enjoy most isn't just the coding—it's the problem-solving, the "aha!" moments, and sharing what I've learned with others. 
		Whether I'm helping our church with their live stream setup, building something new for fun, or teaching a grandchild how computers 
		work, I get genuinely excited about making things work better and helping people connect with technology in meaningful ways.
	</p>

	<h2>Things I'm Working On</h2>
	<p><strong>This Website</strong> – You're looking at it! I rebuilt this site from scratch because I wanted a place that truly reflected who I am. It's where I can share everything from family stories to the latest tech project I'm excited about.</p>
	<p><strong>Church Tech</strong> – I love helping our church connect with people through technology. Whether it's live streaming services or making sure the sound system doesn't embarrass the pastor, it's rewarding work that serves our community.</p>
	<p><strong>Side Projects</strong> – I'm always tinkering with something. Sometimes it's a useful tool, sometimes it's just for fun. I believe the best way to learn is by building things, even if they're just for me and my family.</p>
	<p><strong>Family Time</strong> – The most important project of all. Whether it's planning family gatherings, teaching a grandchild something new, or just being present for the people I love.</p>

	<h2>A Little About My Background</h2>
	<p>I've been fortunate to have varied experiences that shaped who I am today. My time in the Air Force taught me discipline, problem-solving, and how to stay calm when things get hectic—skills that serve me well whether I'm debugging code or helping a grandchild with homework.</p>
	<p>Over the years, I've worked with technology in different ways, from building business applications to creating simple solutions that make people's lives easier. But honestly, what I love most is when technology helps bring people together or solves a real problem someone is facing.</p>

	<h2>Let's Be Friends</h2>
	<p>I love connecting with people who share similar interests or just want to chat about life. Whether you're a fellow grandparent, someone learning to code, a foodie looking for recipe ideas, or just someone who enjoys genuine conversation, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
